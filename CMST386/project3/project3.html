					<h2>Impact of Responsive Design</h2>
					<p>There are several benefits of adding a responsive design to your website, from increasing mobile usage and better user experience, to reduced page load times and even being good for SEO. Coined in 2010, by Ethan Marcotte, Responsive Web design helps designers fully take advantage of the different screens sizes and viewable devices commonly used today. </p>

					<h2>Google Analytics Reports</h2>
					<p>Google Analytics was created to measure your advertising return of interest and track your video and social networking sites and applications. They offer a wide range of user reports such as mobile overview, navigation summary and site speed overview all aimed at helping organizations improve and meet website goals. The mobile overview report is efficient because it helps find pain points in your mobile site, as mobile users account for a large portion of web traffic. The navigation summary report shows the most common paths users take to navigate your site, leading to optimization and creating shortcuts. Slow loading pages are frustrating for users and will cause low web traffic flow. Google’s site speed overview report will help tackle this problem.</p>
