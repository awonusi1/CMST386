					<p>In some cases, a person’s symptoms, emotions, or behaviors may require care in an inpatient setting. The Inpatient Care unit at Delcamp Professions is designed for patients 18 years and older who require 24-hour care. We focus on patient-tailored recovery and work to reintegrate our patients into the community as soon as possible. Our structured environment includes individual and group therapies, group activities, and medication management and education.

					Our trained staff is comprised of psychiatrists, physicians, nurses, counselors, therapists, case managers, and peer recovery coaches. Our goal is to treat patients with acute psychiatric symptoms, who may present a danger to themselves or others, and prepare them to return to their communities and daily responsibilities and activities.

					Upon admission to our program, patients will undergo medical evaluation and diagnosis. Our medical staff will them recommend a treatment plan, which typically includes medication, and begin establishing a plan for discharge.

					If you or a loved one family member is struggling with mental illness, behavioral health issues, or addiction, you are not alone. Our team of professionals is available to help.</p>

					<h3>Crisis Stabilization for Behavioral Health Patients</h3>
					<p>The inpatient unit at Delcamp Professional is a short-term facility focused on recovery and reintegration into the community. Many of our patients will receive referrals to outpatient services or our partial hospitalization program. We address a patient’s immediate crisis and then connect them with a longer term treatment plan and community resources upon discharge.

					Our unit is equipped with state-of-the-art psychiatry safety features, as well as 24-hour monitoring. We also provide 24-hour nursing care. Our structured environment allows patients to participate in group and individual therapies and activities. Each session is designed to empower patients with coping skills and exercises that will help manage their symptoms. We emphasize the importance of understanding your diagnosis and symptoms.</p>

				<section class="col-6 col-s-6">
					<h3>How Families and Caregivers Can Participate in Recovery</h3>
					<p>At Delcamp Professional, we encourage families and caregivers to be active in their loved one’s recovery. With the patient’s permission, our staff will include family members and caregivers in the development and recommendation of treatment plans. Our social workers and nurse practitioners conduct may family meetings and provide condition, symptom, and medication education.

					Our experts believe families and caregivers can play a pivotal role in a patient’s treatment and recovery. We ask that you be patient with your loved one and listen as they present concerns, feelings, or thoughts. Take these thoughts seriously and try to provide support.

					We understand caring for someone with mental, emotional, or behavioral health challenges can be difficult and you might also need support. Our team is here to help you and we can connect you with resources, such as therapy or counseling sessions.</p>
				</section>
			
				<section class="col-6 col-s-9">
					<h3>Continued Treatment and Community Resources</h3>
					<p>During a patient’s stay at Delcamp Professional inpatient unit, our team is focused on creating and achieving an attainable and realistic longer term treatment plan. While our patients may only be in our care for a few days, it’s important they leave feeling empowered with new tools and resources to continue treatment.

					Many mental and behavioral health challenges will require continued treatment. Our staff will work with our patients and their families to ensure they have safe, stable housing and access to other necessities. We understand that recovery and prevention of relapse involves a holistic, comprehensive treatment plan. We collaborate with various services, specialists, and resources across the state of Maryland and we’re committed to helping you find the best care.</p>
