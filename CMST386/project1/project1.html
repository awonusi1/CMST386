					<h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
					<p>In 1993, Mathew Gray developed a program called Wandex,
					which is credited to being the first search engine in a form that we are familiar with.
					Although programs like Archie and Gopher first introduced concepts of indexing files and searching plain text, Wandex is the first program to allow users to index files and search for indexes
					on the web (Ledford, 2009); Wandex is known for introducing the concept of web crawling,
					which goal is to learn what every webpage on the web is about,
					so that the information can be retrieved when it is needed ("What Is a Web Crawler?," 2021).
					By 1998, there were at least (10) prominent search engines, including Yahoo!, Google, and MSN.</p>

					<h2>Meta Tag Keywords & Descriptions</h2>
					<p>When web crawlers find a webpage, the content to include its HTML and CSS,
					is rendered then indexed and ranked. Search engine rankings are important because
					this will determine essentially if your webpage will be seen by internet users;
					This can be impactful on any business aspects that rely on promoting its products and services.
					To ensure good search engine rankings,  keywords and descriptions are placed in meta tags of HTML pages,
					to further assist web crawlers in finding the essential information needed to properly index your files, giving your webpages a better chances of matching a user’s web search.</p>

				<h2>Heading Hierarchy</h2>
					<p>Good heading hierarchy means all guidelines and standards set by WCAG are met. 
					The goal of W3C was to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility
					that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally (Henry, 2020). 
					HTML headings not only communicates the organization of the content on your webpage, but it allows web browsers and assistive technologies to use them to provide in-page navigation and ease of use
					for users with disabilities (Eggert & Abou-Zahra, 2019).</p>
